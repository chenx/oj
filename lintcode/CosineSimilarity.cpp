/**
Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors of an 
inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. 
The cosine of 0Â° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any other angle.

See wiki: Cosine Similarity

Here is the formula:

/media/problem/cosine-similarity.png

Given two vectors A and B with the same size, calculate the cosine similarity.

Return 2.0000 if cosine similarity is invalid (for example A = [0] and B = [0]).
Have you met this question in a real interview?
Example

Given A = [1, 2, 3], B = [2, 3 ,4].

Return 0.9926.

Given A = [0], B = [0].

Return 2.0000
