/**
Update Bits

    Description
    Notes
    Testcase
    Judge

Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. 
Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e g , 
M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j)

Notice

In the function, the numbers N and M will given in decimal, you 
should also return a decimal number.
Clarification

You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to 
fit all of M. That is, if M=10011ï¼Œ you can assume that there are 
at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have 
j=3 and i=2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.

Example

Given N=(10000000000)2, M=(10101)2, i=2, j=6

return N=(10001010100)2
Challenge

Minimum number of operations?
