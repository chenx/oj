Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined 
between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants 
(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
