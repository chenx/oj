Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

    The left of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly less than the node's key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly greater than the node's key.
    Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
