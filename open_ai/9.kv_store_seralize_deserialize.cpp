Implement serialization and deserialization for a key-value store where both keys and values 
can contain any characters including delimiters. You can't use simple delimiters because they 
might appear in the data. Most candidates land on length-prefix encoding (like 3:key5:value), 
which is the same pattern used in Redis protocol.
