/**
3477. Fruits Into Baskets II
Easy

You are given two arrays of integers, fruits and baskets, each of length n, where fruits[i] represents 
the quantity of the ith type of fruit, and baskets[j] represents the capacity of the jth basket.

From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:

    Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or 
        equal to the quantity of that fruit type.
    Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.
    If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.

Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.
