/**
3423. Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array
Easy

Given a circular array nums, find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements.

Note: In a circular array, the first and last elements are adjacent.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,4]

Output: 3

Explanation:

Because nums is circular, nums[0] and nums[2] are adjacent. They have the maximum absolute difference of |4 - 1| = 3.
