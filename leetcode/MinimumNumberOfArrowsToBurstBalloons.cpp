/**
There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. 
The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes 
a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact 
y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along 
the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. 
There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, 
bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
