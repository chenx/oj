/**
Best Meeting Point My Submissions Question
Difficulty: Hard

A group of two or more people wants to meet and minimize the total travel distance. 
You are given a 2D grid of values 0 or 1, where each 1 marks the home of someone in 
the group. The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where 
distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.

For example, given three people living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2):

1 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2+2+2=6 
is minimal. So return 6.

Hint:

Try to solve it in one dimension first. How can this solution apply to the 
two dimension case?
