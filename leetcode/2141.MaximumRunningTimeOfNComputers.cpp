/**
2141. Maximum Running Time of N Computers
Hard

You have n computers. You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed integer array batteries where the 
ith battery can run a computer for batteries[i] minutes. You are interested in running all n computers 
simultaneously using the given batteries.

Initially, you can insert at most one battery into each computer. After that and at any integer time 
moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery any number of times. The 
inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that 
the removing and inserting processes take no time.

Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.

Return the maximum number of minutes you can run all the n computers simultaneously.
